                <h11>The Pop Culture.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">Pop culture, which once entertained people in a wholesome way, has increasingly
                    shifted towards performers removing their clothes for money. Today, youth idolize celebrities based
                    primarily on their looks, disregarding whether these figures contribute positively to society or
                    impart valuable lessons. These idols often prioritize gaining likes and money over considering the
                    impact their actions have on their young audience. As a result, exposing their bodies on camera has
                    become normalized, influencing their followers to believe that such behavior is acceptable.
                    Unfortunately, neither the government nor societal and cultural institutions are addressing this
                    issue. Instead, they often blame the youth for their perceived weaknesses, ignoring the detrimental
                    influence that modern pop culture exerts on them.</span></p>

            <div class="card">
                <h11>The concept of God.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">Religious individuals often strive to prove the existence of God. This can stem
                    from being compelled in childhood to attend religious services or read holy texts, or from not
                    feeling empowered to question their upbringing. As a result, they may choose to rely on faith in God
                    as a lifelong source of motivation and emotional support, despite the lack of empirical evidence for
                    God's existence. The idea of God can be seen as something
                    created to help people feel better and keep society in order, especially in a world where true
                    love and kindness often seem rare. Believing in a higher power offers comfort to those facing
                    tough times, acting as a way to cope with feeling powerless or alone. Historically, religious
                    beliefs and institutions have promoted good behavior, reduced despair, and prevented chaos, thus
                    lowering suicide rates. However, some argue that this use of religion is a way to control
                    people, making them follow rules not because they are true but because it keeps society stable.
                    From this view, religion manipulates people, while atheism encourages questioning and seeking
                    truth based on evidence and reason. Atheism promotes understanding the world through science and
                    facts, freeing people from blindly following beliefs without proof. While belief in God can
                    inspire good actions, atheism offers a clear, evidence-based approach to life, valuing
                    intellectual freedom and critical thinking.</span></p>

                <h11>The Propaganda of Religion.</h11>
                <p class="paragraph">The Propaganda of religion: In the modern perspective religion is nothing but
                    another name for propaganda for people, in which they believe and will sacrifice themselves and kill
                    people in the name of religion. Religion in a broader sense started as a tool of rationality as the
                    man was too afraid of certain things, earlier religion
                    tried to reason things but as there is no space for improvements people take them as the only
                    sole reason of life, they'd believe on some fancy pants prophet or arabian barbaric man than a
                    person who has the ability to think, religion now has no other meaning, politicians and corrupt
                    people use it for their convenience, take any example Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism
                    to some extent, all these religions are the reason people are dying, bombings, terrorist
                    attacks, all are because of religious extremism, most people who we think are very wise,
                    intelligent, successful are either agnostics or atheists.</span></p>
